The main difference between them is that justify-items apply to grid containers and justify-self applies to grid-
items.
You see in the given code example grid items arranged center along the inline axis, within their respective grid cells.
This property allows us to set the default way of justifying each item in their respective grid cells.
justify-self and align-self properties control the alignment of any specific grid item within its grid cell along the
horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The values can be a start, end, center, or stretch.
